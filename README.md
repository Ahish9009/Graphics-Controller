# VGA Card

## Introduction
This is a project made by Shivansh and me, for the course VLSI Design.
It is a basic VGA card that takes in an image file as input, and displays it on a monitor. 
It has been implemented in both FPGA and ASIC flows, and has been tested on CRT and LCD monitors with a FPGA board.
